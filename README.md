# Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop 
This program multiplies consecutive numbers starting from 1 and stops when the product initially becomes greater than the given threshold value. 

# Question 2: Nested Dictionary From Strings 
This program used a function to create a new dictionary from a list of strings. 
The value in the dictionary was another string which entailed the length of the given key and the parity (odd/even) of it. 

# Question 3: Safe Function Application 
Using a function, this program computes x^y when given a list of pairs (x,y). 
The program is designed to "continue" past any negative y-values and prints out the valid results as list. 

# Question 4: Sorted Search with Conditions 
Using the random library, this program randomly chooses a value for x and for values between 0 and 1 which are contained in a list. 
Using a for loop, the program checks for values greater than or equal to x and prints out the sorted version of the randomized list, the randomized x value and the first index where x meets the given condition. 

# Question 5: Circle Area Comparison and Validation 
This program uses a function to take valid radii of two circles to compute the area of each circle and then return the percentage of the larger circle's area that can be covered by the smaller circle. 
Invalid inputs are also considered in this program and error messages are displayed. 

# Question 6: Distribution Analysis 
This program uses a function that returns a dictionary by first recieving a list of numbers and looping through them to select unique keys (not already inputed). 
The program selects the values as the percentage of elements consisting in the list that are less than or equal to the corresponding key. 

# Question 7: Time Conversion Function 
Using a function, this program takes valid input of seconds after midnight and converts that into hours, minutes, seconds and am or pm. 
The program accounts for a 12 hour time period rather than a 24 hour one and invalid inputs display error messages. 
It returns the outcome as a formatted string. 

# Question 8: Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column 
The program imports the pandas library as pd and then prints the data dictionary as a DataFrame. 
Then, using the existing columns a new column is created, added to the DataFrame and the output of the final DataFrame is printed.
